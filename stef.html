<p><b>Full Name:</b> Stefano Gabriel Cardoso Claro</p>
<p><b>Nationality:</b> South Africa (Johannesburg)</p>
<p><b>Birth Date:</b> 20 November 1997</p>
<p><b>Siblings:</b> Older Brother(25 years old); Sandro Claro</p>
<p><b>My Early Life...</b> I was born in South Africa and lived there for 17 years. Life in Africa is an incredible thing to experiance, from the naturaly beauty, to the cultral diversity. Since South Africa is a " Third World" country, the educational mindsets of the youth is very poor and un-motivated. I would go to school just because it was fun, instead of going to class we would bunk and go and play soccer on the streets. My educational future was dim, until certain things happened in my life that led me to focus on creating a better future for myself.</p>
<p><b>How did i end up in Portugal?:</b> <br>

My parents were both born in Angola ( Mother(Benguela) - Father ( Luanda). They lived their early childhood in Angola until they were forced to run away due to the civil war. They both moved to POrtugal ( where they would meet and start dating), after a few years theydecided to move to South Africa wheremy brother and I would later be born. After living all our lives in Africa my parents felt like the best decision for my future would be to move, and simce they had a prior life, as well as family in Portugal, it seemed like the best option. </p>

<p><b>Educational Background:</b> While living in South Africa ; I had a great love for biology, as well as architecture and electrical engineering ( My love for Engineering came from my father who started his own, high voltage electrical company). However, my lack of motivation in school meant that I would not focus suffieciently in my mathematic classes , which is the main part of having a engineering course. <br>
When I moved to Portugal , my father suggested that I follow a business marketing and manegment course, which I thought would be a good idea. </p>
<p><b>My Business course:</b> This idea was short lived, I applied at a university called Universidade Atlantica, who assured I would have classes done in English. On the day that the course began I told that there were not enough Internaational students to create a seperate english course. So I left the course because I was not good enough in the Portguase language. </p>
	<p><b>What was next?</b> <br>
	Since I had to leave the previous university , it was too late to find a new univesity as the courses were no longer acceptingnew students.
I went online and found a small private institution near my house that offered a Business Programming Course , that would offer a degree for a partner university in Worchester, England.
I jumped straight into it and this is where I would first encounter programming. I was finally enjoying what i was doing, one month before we would have our exams the owner of the institution dissapeared, and took all the funding of the school. So once again I was left with no direction in what to do next.
</p>
<P><b>What did I do?</b>
I searched online for universities that were offering courses in english , preferbly courses about programming
<br> This is when i found the Games and Apps Programming course at Universidade Europeia - IADE. </P>
<p><b>My experience at IADE ( so far)</b> <br>
I feel as if ive finaly found somthing that im genuily interseted in, and enjoy. My lack of programming experiance and basic computer skills makes it hard for me to grasp certain things, but the level of teaching offered at IADE makes it alot easier to be integratted into new areas of skillls needed to be a proficient programmer.
